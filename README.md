# Algorithm_Visual

## Overview
This project is a visualizer for sorting and graph algorithms, built using C++ and SFML in Xcode. The project opens to a main menu, where the user can select either sorting or graph algorithms. The sorting algorithm visualizer displays how multiple sorting algorithms can work on a 80 or 200 - number list. The graph algorithm visualizer allows the user to build their own graph, placing nodes by clicking, and making nodes neighbors by clicking one node and then the one you want to make it's neighbor. Once a graph is built, the user can perform Depth-First and Breadth-First Searches on the graph with custom target and origin nodes.

## Requirements
macOS, Xcode, SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/)
